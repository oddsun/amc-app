## Notes

Don't forget to add `wsgi.py` for flask app to work with production servers e.g. `gunicorn`. `.flashenv`
and `amc_app.py` are only used for development.

## Files

### `config.py`

sets up database locations. Uses `sqlite` for now.

### `wsgi.py`

is called by production server to serve the Flask app. Options can be used in `app.run(...)`.

### `amc_app.py` and `.flaskenv`

are used for development by development server.

### `app/__init__.py`

sets-up the `flask` app, database, and loads `models` and `routes`.

### `app/models.py`

uses mostly existing database, though `User` and `Response`-related tables could be new database if they don't exist.

`flask-migrate` is used in `app/__init__.py` (in conjunction with `config.py`) to help setup the database
from `app/models.py`.

Use the following command to initialize/create multiple databases as are used in this project:

```
pip install Flask-Migrate
flask db init --multidb
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
```

You can use `migrate` and `upgrade` for subsequent changes to `app/models.py`. Though, there are limitations (
see https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### `app/routes.py`

The controller portion of the MVC paradigm. Pretty straightforward. In this case, all the routes returns `json` objects
that can be parsed by the front-end react app.

### `migrations` directory

auto-generated by `Flask-Migration`. Can delete and redo do database setup if messed up. Though, all previous changes
will be lost.
